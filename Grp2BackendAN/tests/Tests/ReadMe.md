# Test Cases for Project Operations
This project contains test cases for all the entities within the application. 
The tests are designed to validate the functionality of CRUD operations with specific scenarios and validations.

## Getting Started
 => Update the 'SQLServerConnString' in the appsetting.json file of your test project.
 => Run test cases for the project

### Recommended using separate test database
We strongly suggest using a separate test database for testing to keep your development database independent of testing.
